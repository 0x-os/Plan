# Project WebRM

Project WebRM (placeholder name) is an attempt to give users control over the way information is presented to them.

## Overview

WebRM will enable the user to be able to personalise webpages to their preferences. WebRM aims to achieve this by utilise similar techiques to MitB (Man in the Browser) attacks to modify the content of webpages (client-side).

## Road Map

Currently there are three options:
1. Use an extension framework

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Convenient|no control on when updates get pushed meaning vulnerabilities may be prevalent|
||If such framework stops being maintained the could be detimental to WebRM|

2. Create our own extension framework
3. Directly inject coding into the browser
